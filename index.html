   <h1> Playstation Vue's Search Function</h1>
   <p id="firstText">Playstation Vue is a streaming service, comparable to Netflix and Hulu. Although it has a <br /> nice selection of movies and TV shows, it still has a few irritating features in its interface. <br /> One example is its search function. Instead of having a traditional keyboard, we are given the <br/> alphabet and numbers 0-9, laid out vertically. Since this is a streaming service on a playstation <br /> you have to select the letter/or number one by one by moving an on-screen selector. My aim <br/> was to replace this function with a keyboard that is sorted in a way where the most common </br > characters were closer together. This would make the experience a smoother process for those <br> searching for specific movies and shows with their controller. <br> Research shows most users prefer alphabet keyboards over QWERTY keyboard when searching <br> on gaming consoles. To avoid situations like clicking the "over"button 19 times to search for a <br> movie that begins with 'S', my design places these letters at the beginning, and the rest is aligned alphabetically.
